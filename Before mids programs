Question 1: “Write a Python program that randomly suggests an activity from a given list of options.”
#program:
import random
options=["watch a movie","practise python","go for a walk","take a nap"]
print("Ai suggest:",
      random.choice(options))

Question 2:"Write a Python program that acts as a simple medical diagnosis system. The program should ask the user about symptoms
such as fever, cough, and fatigue, and then display a possible health condition based on the user’s responses."
program:
def medical_diagnosis():
    print("Welcome to the diagnostic system")

    fever = input("Do you have a fever? (yes/no): ").lower()
    cough = input("Do you have a cough? (yes/no): ").lower()
    fatigue = input("Do you feel fatigue? (yes/no): ").lower()

    if fever == "yes" and cough == "yes":
        print("Possible flu or COVID-19")
    elif fatigue == "yes":
        print("Possible stress or tiredness")
    else:
        print("You seem to be fine")
medical_diagnosis()
